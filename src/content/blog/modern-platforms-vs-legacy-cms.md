# Modern Platforms vs Legacy CMS: Why It's Time to Evolve Your Website

The web development landscape has evolved dramatically. Modern platforms offer significant advantages over traditional CMS systems built for a different era. This comprehensive analysis explains why businesses are migrating away from legacy systems and what it means for your website strategy.

## Understanding the Platform Categories

### Modern Web Platforms
**Definition**: Built-for-modern-web platforms using current technologies and approaches
**Examples**: Framer, Webflow, Gatsby, Next.js, Nuxt.js
**Characteristics**: Cloud-first, performance-optimized, developer-friendly, security-focused

### Legacy CMS Systems
**Definition**: Content management systems designed 10-20 years ago for different web needs
**Examples**: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento 1.x
**Characteristics**: Database-heavy, plugin-dependent, maintenance-intensive, security-challenging

## The Technology Evolution Gap

### How Web Development Has Changed

**2005-2010 Era (Legacy CMS Origins):**
- Slow internet connections
- Desktop-only browsing
- Simple JavaScript needs
- Basic security requirements

- Security breach recovery costs
- **Year 1-3**: Escalating maintenance costs

### 3-Year Cost Comparison Example

**Modern Platform (Framer/Webflow):**
- Year 1: $8,000 (development) + $500 (hosting) = $8,500
- Year 2: $1,000 (updates) + $500 (hosting) = $1,500  
- Year 3: $1,000 (updates) + $500 (hosting) = $1,500
- **Total**: $11,500

**Legacy WordPress:**
- Year 1: $5,000 (development) + $1,200 (hosting/maintenance) = $6,200
- Year 2: $3,000 (updates/security) + $1,500 (hosting/maintenance) = $4,500
- Year 3: $2,500 (performance issues) + $1,800 (hosting/maintenance) = $4,300
- **Total**: $15,000
