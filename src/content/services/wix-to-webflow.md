## Why Migrate from Wix to Webflow?

Wix website builders served their purpose when you needed something quick and simple, but growing businesses need more than templates can provide. Poor search engine performance, design limitations, slow loading speeds, and lack of professional customization are constraining your business potential.

Webflow represents the evolution beyond website builders - professional visual development that combines design freedom with powerful functionality and enterprise-grade performance.

### Wix Limitations Holding You Back

**Template Trap**: Wix templates look generic and constrain your brand expression. Changing templates means starting over completely, losing all your customization work.

**SEO Struggles**: Wix sites perform poorly in search engine rankings due to bloated code, limited SEO controls, and slow loading speeds that search engines penalize.

**Performance Problems**: Wix sites average 4-8 seconds loading time, causing high bounce rates and lost customers before they see your content.

**Design Constraints**: Want custom layouts? Advanced interactions? Professional animations? Wix's drag-and-drop builder hits walls quickly.

**Mobile Mediocrity**: Wix mobile sites often look cramped and unprofessional compared to custom responsive designs.

**Scalability Limitations**: As your business grows, Wix becomes more expensive without offering significantly more capabilities or flexibility.

**Professional Perception**: Visitors can identify website builder sites, potentially impacting credibility and trust in professional contexts.

**Platform Lock-in**: Wix sites cannot be exported or moved to other platforms - you're permanently locked into their ecosystem.
