## Why Migrate from WordPress to Framer?

WordPress served its purpose, but modern businesses need better solutions. Plugin conflicts, security vulnerabilities, slow loading times, and maintenance headaches are pushing smart businesses toward more elegant platforms.

Framer represents the future of web design - combining powerful visual design tools with modern performance and reliability your WordPress site can't match.
