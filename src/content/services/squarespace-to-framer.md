## Why Migrate from Squarespace to Framer?

Squarespace built its reputation on beautiful templates, but template-based design has fundamental limitations that constraint growing businesses. Design restrictions, performance issues, limited customization options, and lack of advanced functionality hold back brands that need more than cookie-cutter solutions.

Framer represents the future of web design - unlimited creative freedom with professional-grade animations, superior performance, and the flexibility to create exactly what your brand needs to stand out.

### Squarespace Limitations Constraining Your Brand

**Template Prison**: Even Squarespace's "beautiful" templates look similar to thousands of other sites. True brand differentiation requires breaking free from template constraints entirely.

**Design Rigidity**: Want a unique layout? Custom spacing? Non-standard navigation? Squarespace's template system fights you at every step.

**Animation Limitations**: Squarespace offers basic animations while modern websites need sophisticated, engaging micro-interactions and scroll effects.

**Performance Mediocrity**: Squarespace sites average 3-6 seconds loading time, losing visitors and search engine favor before content appears.

**Customization Walls**: Custom CSS helps, but you're still constrained by template structure and Squarespace's rendering system.

**E-commerce Restrictions**: Squarespace e-commerce feels basic compared to custom solutions that optimize conversion at every step.

**Mobile Compromises**: Squarespace mobile sites are template adaptations, not truly optimized mobile experiences.

**Growth Limitations**: As your business evolves, Squarespace templates can't evolve with you - requiring complete redesigns.
