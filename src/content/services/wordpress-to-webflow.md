## Why Migrate from WordPress to Webflow?

WordPress has served millions of websites, but its 2003 architecture shows its age. Plugin conflicts, security vulnerabilities, constant maintenance, and performance issues plague WordPress sites daily.

Webflow represents modern web development - combining visual design freedom with clean code generation, built-in hosting, and zero maintenance requirements.

### WordPress Problems Webflow Solves

**Security Nightmares**: WordPress powers 40% of the web, making it the biggest target for hackers. Plugins introduce vulnerabilities faster than they're patched.

**Plugin Dependency Hell**: WordPress sites rely on dozens of plugins that conflict, break, and require constant updates. One plugin failure can crash your entire site.

**Performance Bottlenecks**: WordPress sites average 3-7 second loading times due to plugin bloat, inefficient themes, and poor database optimization.

**Maintenance Burden**: WordPress requires weekly updates, daily backups, security monitoring, and constant attention to keep running smoothly.

**Design Constraints**: WordPress themes limit creativity. Custom designs require expensive developer time and complex child theme management.

**Hidden Costs**: Free WordPress becomes expensive with hosting, premium plugins, security services, developer time, and emergency fixes.

**Technical Complexity**: Managing WordPress requires server knowledge, database skills, and security expertise most business owners lack.
