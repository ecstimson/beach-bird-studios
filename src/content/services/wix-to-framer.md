## Why Migrate from Wix to Framer?

Wix served its purpose when you needed a website quickly, but growing businesses outgrow website builders fast. Template limitations, poor SEO performance, slow loading speeds, and lack of customization control are holding your business back.

Framer represents professional web development - unlimited design freedom, advanced animations, superior performance, and the flexibility to create exactly what your business needs.

### Wix Limitations That Hurt Your Business

**Template Prison**: Wix templates constrain your creativity and make your site look like thousands of others. Breaking free requires starting over completely.

**SEO Weakness**: Wix sites struggle in search rankings due to poor code structure, limited optimization options, and slow loading times.

**Performance Problems**: Wix sites average 4-8 seconds loading time, causing visitors to leave before seeing your content.

**Limited Customization**: Want a unique layout? Custom interactions? Advanced animations? Wix's builder can't deliver professional-grade customization.

**Mobile Limitations**: Wix mobile sites often look cramped and unprofessional compared to desktop versions.

**Scalability Issues**: As your business grows, Wix becomes more limiting and expensive without offering more capabilities.

**Professional Credibility**: Visitors can tell when a site is built with a website builder, potentially impacting trust and conversions.

**Export Impossibility**: Your Wix site can't be exported or moved to better platforms - you're locked in forever.
