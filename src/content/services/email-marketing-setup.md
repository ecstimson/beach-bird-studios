# Email Marketing Setup That Turns Subscribers Into Customers

Build an automated email marketing system that nurtures leads and drives consistent sales for your Wilmington business.

## Most Businesses Are Leaving Money on the Table

You're capturing leads through your website, but then what happens? Most businesses have no system to follow up with potential customers, letting hot prospects go cold while competitors with automated email marketing swoop in and make the sale.

**Email marketing delivers the highest ROI of any digital marketing channel.**
