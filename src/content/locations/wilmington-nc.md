80% of consumers search for local businesses at least once a week, with 32% searching daily.  When Wilmington residents need a service, they turn to Google first. The question isn't whether they'll find someone, it's whether they'll find you or your competitor.

Customers are 2.7 times more likely to trust a business with a complete Google Business Profile.  Your website and online presence serve as your digital storefront. When potential customers find you ranking at the top with a professional website, it builds immediate credibility. Your colleagues notice when you dominate searches.
