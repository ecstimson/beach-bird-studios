## Understanding Leland's Growth Market

Leland represents one of North Carolina's most dynamic growth stories. What was once a small river town has transformed into Brunswick County's fastest-growing municipality, with population increasing over 300% since 2000. This explosive growth creates unprecedented opportunities for businesses positioned to serve both new residents and the expanding commercial corridor.

Your business operates in a market where established local companies compete alongside new ventures serving relocated families from across the country. The right digital strategy doesn't just capture current customers - it positions you for continued growth as Leland evolves into a major regional hub.

The challenge and opportunity lie in serving both longtime locals who remember when Leland was truly small-town and newcomers arriving with metropolitan expectations for service and convenience.
