# Email Setup Instructions for Contact Form

The contact form is now functional and will work immediately for testing. However, to receive emails at eric@beachbirdstudios.com, you need to set up an email service.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Web3Forms (Recommended - Free)

1. Go to https://web3forms.com
2. Click "Get Access Key" (no signup required initially)
3. Enter eric@beachbirdstudios.com as the email
4. You'll receive an access key via email
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
   ```
6. Restart your development server

### Option 2: Formspree (Also Free)

1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx)
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id
   ```
6. Restart your development server

## Testing the Form

Even without email setup, the form will:
- Validate all fields properly
- Show success/error messages
- Log submissions to the console (for development)
- Provide a good user experience

## What's Been Fixed

✅ **Contact Form**
- Added full form validation
- Created API endpoint at `/api/contact`
- Added loading states and user feedback
- Implemented success/error messaging
- Form data is properly processed
- Email-ready with multiple service options

✅ **Blog Category Filtering**

## Next Steps

1. Choose an email service (Web3Forms is easiest)
2. Add your credentials to `.env` file
3. Test the form submission
4. Deploy to production

The form will work immediately for testing purposes and will log all submissions to the console until you configure an email service.
